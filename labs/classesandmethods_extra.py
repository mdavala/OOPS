Let's build on the last example, with invoices. Sometimes, a customer
will submit one large payment for several invoices. And it may only
partially cover one of them. Create a CustomerAccount class to manage
the nuances of this.

>>> customer_name = 'James Jones'
>>> account = CustomerAccount(customer_name)
>>> type(account)
<class '__main__.CustomerAccount'>

Did you know Python class objects have a __name__ attribute?
>>> type(account).__name__
'CustomerAccount'
>>> account.name
'James Jones'

This will use the Invoice class you just created. (Just copy its class
definition into this lab. Or you can import it, if you prefer.)

>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(1, customer_name, 20.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
1
>>> account.total_due()
20.0
>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(2, customer_name, 25.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
2
>>> account.total_due()
45.0
>>> account.add_invoice(Invoice(3, customer_name, 30.0))
>>> len(account.invoices)
3
>>> account.total_due()
75.0

>>> unpaid = account.unpaid_invoices()
>>> len(unpaid)
3
>>> type(unpaid[0]).__name__
'Invoice'
>>> unpaid[0].number
1
>>> unpaid[0].amount
20.0

>>> account.apply_payment(20)
>>> now_unpaid = account.unpaid_invoices()
>>> len(now_unpaid)
2
>>> now_unpaid[0].number
2
>>> account.total_due()
55.0

>>> account.apply_payment(10)
>>> account.total_due()
45.0
>>> len(account.unpaid_invoices())
2

>>> account.apply_payment(45)
>>> len(account.unpaid_invoices())
0
